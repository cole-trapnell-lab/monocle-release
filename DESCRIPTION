Title: Clustering, differential expression, and trajectory analysis for single-
    cell RNA-Seq

Description: Monocle performs differential expression and time-series analysis
    for single-cell expression experiments. It orders individual cells
    according to progress through a biological process, without knowing ahead
    of time which genes define progress through that process. Monocle also
    performs differential expression analysis, clustering, visualization, and
    other useful tasks on single cell expression data.  It is designed to work
    with RNA-Seq and qPCR data, but could be used with other types as well.
